This library implements the color representations RGB, HSV, HSL, and HSI with functions to convert 
between each type of representations. It also implements the Color trait and ColorMap trait 
which can be used to define custom colors and color maps.

This library is made to help implement colors in other libraries like plotting or
other visualization libraries with shortcuts for common color maps in the "colors" and "maps" module.
